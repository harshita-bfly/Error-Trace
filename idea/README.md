"Communities, countries, and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women."

Providing women with appropriate awareness regarding health, safety and security is as much important as providing them equality rights and accessible education.
But somewhere, somehow these essentials are overlooked.
This is an initiative to enhance this method in modernistic approach with real life scenarios.
Women often feel intimidated speaking about health issues in public
which sparks feeling of inferiority. Hence women are ought to unite for each other to provide a better future. 


We have developed a solution that can contribute to make a little change and can help many women to become aware.
It is a project entitled,  #SheCure   with tagline "Health Is What She Care The Most!"

It involves multiple features like security ,safety and health.

We have incorporated a chat system among same age groups.
Not only this much but knowledge related to  every day's health issues,  awareness about opportunities , encompassing technologies and self help section.
It accommodate everything ranging from learning to fun.
